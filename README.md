# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm EmiriðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I have seven years of experience in corporate sales within the food industry.  
During this time, I witnessed the use of AI for demand forecasting and inventory management, which ignited my strong interest  
in the IT sector.  
As a result, I decided to transition into the IT field.  

I am currently undergoing intensive training at a school (from August to December 2024),  where I am gaining foundational skills in programming languages and practical technologies.    
Moving forward, I am committed to learning various programming languages and technologies to pursue a career in the IT industry.
