# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Emiri

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I have seven years of experience in corporate sales within the food industry.   
During this time, I witnessed the use of AI for demand forecasting and inventory management, which sparked my strong interest in the IT sector.  

As a result, I decided to transition into the IT field and am currently undergoing intensive training at a school (from August to December 2024).   
I am acquiring foundational skills in programming languages and practical technologies.  
Moving forward, I am focused on learning various programming languages and technologies to pursue a career in the IT industry.
